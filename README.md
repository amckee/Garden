# Garden
Collection of scripts used on a Raspberry Pi to automate indoor garden lighting.

Using the GPIO pins to control a 4-relay bank to control an outlet used by the grow lights.

I make use of a button to activate the lights for 5 minutes. Useful for working on the garden
or just checking on things after hours.

Of course, make sure you either follow the pinout or adjust the scripts accordingly.

Todo List:
- Add soil moisture sensors
- Automate watering when needed
